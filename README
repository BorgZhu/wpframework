This is a little framework that I've written so that I finally can write OO-plugins for WordPress.
You can create actions and filter methods that will automaticly get called.
This class is still in a *beta* stage so let me know if you have any tips, suggestions or find any bugs.

I've included 4 examples so you can take a look how you can write plugins with this framework. 
The following examples are included:
- Dashboard widget
- Widget
- Custom post type
- Plugin
