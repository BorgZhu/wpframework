This is a little framework that I've written so that I finally can write OO-plugins for WordPress.
You can create action and filter methods that will automaticly get called.
This class is still in a <strong>beta</strong> stage so let me know if you have any tips, suggestions or find any bugs.

For the moment there is no documentation available because the class is still in heavy development.
